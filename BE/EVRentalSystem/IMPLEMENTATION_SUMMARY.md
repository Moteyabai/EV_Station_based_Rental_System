# Summary of Changes

## ?? Critical Bug Fix

### Fixed: Entity Framework Context Disposal Error

**File:** `Repositories/RenterRepository.cs`

**Problem:** 
The `GetRenterByAccountIDAsync` method was wrapping the shared `_context` instance in a `using` statement, which disposed the context after the method completed. Since the repository uses the Singleton pattern, this disposed context was being reused for subsequent calls, causing the error:

```
Cannot access a disposed context instance. A common cause of this error is disposing a context instance that was resolved from dependency injection and then later trying to use the same context instance elsewhere in your application.
```

**Root Cause:**
```csharp
// WRONG - This disposes the shared _context
using (var context = _context)
{
    renter = await context.Renters.Include(a => a.Account).SingleOrDefaultAsync(r => r.AccountID == accID);
}
```

The `_context` is a field initialized in the `BaseRepository` constructor and shared across all repository method calls. Wrapping it in a `using` statement causes it to be disposed, making it unavailable for subsequent operations.

**Solution:**
```csharp
// CORRECT - Use _context directly without disposal
var renter = await _context.Renters
    .Include(a => a.Account)
    .SingleOrDefaultAsync(r => r.AccountID == accID);
```

**Why This Fixes It:**
- The `_context` is managed by the `BaseRepository` class
- It's created once when the repository singleton instance is initialized
- It should not be manually disposed in individual methods
- The dependency injection container or repository lifecycle should manage disposal

## ? New Feature: StationStaff Controller

### Created Files:

1. **`BusinessObject/Models/DTOs/StationStaffDTOs.cs`** - DTOs for StationStaff operations:
   - `StationStaffCreateDTO` - Create new staff
   - `StationStaffUpdateDTO` - Update staff info
   - `StationStaffAssignDTO` - Assign staff to station
   - `StationStaffSearchDTO` - Search filters
   - `StationStaffStatisticsDTO` - Statistics data
   - `StationStaffSummaryDTO` - Summary info

2. **`API/Controllers/StationStaffController.cs`** - Full CRUD controller with endpoints:

### API Endpoints:

#### Basic CRUD Operations (Admin Only)

- **GET** `/api/StationStaff/GetAllStaff` - Get all station staff
- **GET** `/api/StationStaff/GetStaffById/{id}` - Get staff by ID (Admin or Staff themselves)
- **POST** `/api/StationStaff/CreateStaff` - Create new staff
  ```json
  {
    "accountID": 1,
    "stationID": 1  // Optional
  }
  ```
- **PUT** `/api/StationStaff/UpdateStaff` - Update staff information
  ```json
  {
    "staffID": 1,
    "stationID": 2,
    "handoverTimes": 10,
    "receiveTimes": 8
  }
  ```
- **DELETE** `/api/StationStaff/DeleteStaff/{id}` - Delete staff

#### Station Assignment (Admin Only)

- **PUT** `/api/StationStaff/AssignToStation` - Assign staff to a station
  ```json
  {
    "staffID": 1,
    "stationID": 2
  }
  ```
- **PUT** `/api/StationStaff/RemoveFromStation/{staffId}` - Remove staff from their station

#### Performance Tracking (Staff or Admin)

- **PUT** `/api/StationStaff/IncrementHandover/{staffId}` - Increment handover count (when staff hands over a bike)
- **PUT** `/api/StationStaff/IncrementReceive/{staffId}` - Increment receive count (when staff receives a bike back)

#### Search & Analytics (Admin Only)

- **POST** `/api/StationStaff/SearchStaff` - Search staff with filters
  ```json
  {
    "stationID": 1,
    "accountID": 5,
    "minHandoverTimes": 5,
    "minReceiveTimes": 3
  }
  ```
- **GET** `/api/StationStaff/GetStaffStatistics` - Get comprehensive statistics
  - Total staff count
  - Staff with/without stations
  - Total handover/receive times
  - Average handover/receive per staff
  - Staff count by station

### Features:

? Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
? Station assignment and removal
? Performance tracking (handover/receive counts)
? Search and filtering capabilities
? Statistical analysis
? Proper authorization (Admin-only for management, Staff can view own data)
? Validation for all inputs
? Error handling with meaningful messages
? Consistent with existing controller patterns

### Authorization Rules:

- **Admin (RoleID = 3):** Full access to all operations
- **Staff (RoleID = 2):** Can view own information and update own handover/receive counts
- **Renter (RoleID = 1):** No access

## ? Build Status

All changes compile successfully with no errors.

---

## ?? Testing Recommendations

### Bug Fix Testing:
1. Test the `PaymentController.RenterCreatePayment` endpoint that was causing the error
2. Verify that multiple sequential calls don't cause context disposal errors
3. Test concurrent requests to ensure the context is properly shared

### StationStaff Controller Testing:
1. **Create Staff:** Test creating staff with and without station assignment
2. **Update Staff:** Test updating station assignment, handover/receive counts
3. **Assign/Remove:** Test station assignment and removal
4. **Performance Tracking:** Test incrementing handover/receive counts
5. **Search:** Test various search filters
6. **Statistics:** Verify statistics calculation accuracy
7. **Authorization:** Test that only authorized users can access each endpoint

## ?? Impact

### Bug Fix Impact:
- **High Priority** - This was a critical bug preventing payment creation
- Affects all rental/payment workflows
- Should be deployed immediately to production

### New Feature Impact:
- **Medium Priority** - Adds new functionality for staff management
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Follows existing patterns and conventions
- Ready for immediate use

---

## ?? Usage Example

### Creating a staff member:
```http
POST /api/StationStaff/CreateStaff
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "accountID": 10,
  "stationID": 2
}
```

### Assigning staff to a different station:
```http
PUT /api/StationStaff/AssignToStation
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "staffID": 5,
  "stationID": 3
}
```

### Recording a bike handover:
```http
PUT /api/StationStaff/IncrementHandover/5
Authorization: Bearer {staff_or_admin_token}
```

### Getting statistics:
```http
GET /api/StationStaff/GetStaffStatistics
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "totalStaff": 15,
  "staffWithStation": 12,
  "staffWithoutStation": 3,
  "totalHandoverTimes": 234,
  "totalReceiveTimes": 210,
  "averageHandoverPerStaff": 15.6,
  "averageReceivePerStaff": 14.0,
  "staffCountByStation": {
    "1": 5,
    "2": 4,
    "3": 3
  }
}
```

## ?? Security Considerations

- All endpoints require authentication (`[Authorize]` attribute)
- Role-based access control enforced for admin-only operations
- Staff can only modify their own performance metrics
- Input validation on all DTOs
- Authorization checks before any data modification
