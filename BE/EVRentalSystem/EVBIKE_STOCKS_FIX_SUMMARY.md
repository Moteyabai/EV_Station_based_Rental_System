# ? EVBIKE_STOCKS FOREIGN KEY FIX - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## ?? Problem
```
SqlException: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint 
"FK_EVBike_Stocks_EVBikes_EVBikeBikeID". The conflict occurred in database 
"EVRenterDB", table "dbo.EVBikes", column 'BikeID'.
```

## ?? Root Cause
Entity Framework created a **shadow foreign key property** `EVBikeBikeID` instead of using the explicit `BikeID` property defined in your model.

---

## ? Solution Implemented

### Files Modified/Created:

1. ? **DbContext Configuration** (`Repositories/DBContext/EVRenterDBContext.cs`)
   - Added explicit foreign key mapping

2. ? **New Migration** (`Repositories/Migrations/20251026081500_Fix_EVBikeStocks_ForeignKey_BikeID.cs`)
   - Drops shadow column `EVBikeBikeID`
   - Creates correct FK using `BikeID`

3. ? **Updated Snapshot** (`Repositories/Migrations/EVRenterDBContextModelSnapshot.cs`)
   - Removed shadow property
   - Fixed FK configuration

4. ? **Documentation** 
   - `FIX_EVBIKE_STOCKS_FK_ISSUE.md` - Detailed explanation
   - `APPLY_EVBIKE_STOCKS_FIX.md` - Step-by-step guide
   - `apply-evbikestocks-fix.ps1` - Automation script

---

## ?? Quick Start - Apply the Fix

### Method 1: PowerShell Script (Easiest)
```powershell
# In PowerShell (as Administrator if needed)
.\apply-evbikestocks-fix.ps1
```

### Method 2: Package Manager Console
```powershell
# In Visual Studio -> Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console
Update-Database
```

### Method 3: .NET CLI
```bash
cd D:\Github_Projects\EV_Station_based_Rental_System\BE\EVRentalSystem
dotnet ef database update --project Repositories --startup-project API
```

---

## ?? What the Migration Does

### Before:
```sql
CREATE TABLE EVBike_Stocks (
    StockID int PRIMARY KEY,
    BikeID int,              -- Not used as FK!
    EVBikeBikeID int,        -- Shadow FK (WRONG!)
    StationID int,
    ...
    CONSTRAINT FK_EVBike_Stocks_EVBikes_EVBikeBikeID 
        FOREIGN KEY (EVBikeBikeID) REFERENCES EVBikes(BikeID)
)
```

### After:
```sql
CREATE TABLE EVBike_Stocks (
    StockID int PRIMARY KEY,
    BikeID int,              -- Correct FK! ?
    StationID int,
    ...
    CONSTRAINT FK_EVBike_Stocks_EVBikes_BikeID 
        FOREIGN KEY (BikeID) REFERENCES EVBikes(BikeID)
            ON DELETE NO ACTION  -- Restrict
)
```

---

## ? Verification Checklist

After applying the migration, verify:

### 1. Check Foreign Keys
```sql
SELECT 
    fk.name AS ForeignKeyName,
    COL_NAME(fkc.parent_object_id, fkc.parent_column_id) AS ColumnName,
    OBJECT_NAME(fk.referenced_object_id) AS ReferencedTable
FROM sys.foreign_keys AS fk
INNER JOIN sys.foreign_key_columns AS fkc 
    ON fk.object_id = fkc.constraint_object_id
WHERE OBJECT_NAME(fk.parent_object_id) = 'EVBike_Stocks'
```

**Expected:**
- ? `FK_EVBike_Stocks_EVBikes_BikeID` (BikeID ? EVBikes)
- ? `FK_EVBike_Stocks_Stations_StationID` (StationID ? Stations)

**NOT:**
- ? `FK_EVBike_Stocks_EVBikes_EVBikeBikeID`

### 2. Check Table Structure
```sql
EXEC sp_columns 'EVBike_Stocks'
```

**Should see:**
- StockID
- BikeID ?
- Color
- StationID ?
- LicensePlate
- Status
- CreatedAt
- UpdatedAt

**Should NOT see:**
- EVBikeBikeID ?

---

## ?? Test the Fix

### Test 1: Create Stock via API
```http
POST /api/EVBikeStocks/CreateStock
Authorization: Bearer {your_staff_or_admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bikeID": 1,
  "color": 1,
  "stationID": 1,
  "licensePlate": "29A-12345",
  "status": 1
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Thêm xe vào kho thành công!"
}
```

### Test 2: Verify Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM EVBike_Stocks WHERE LicensePlate = '29A-12345'
```

### Test 3: Verify FK Works
```sql
-- Should fail (referential integrity)
DELETE FROM EVBikes WHERE BikeID = 1  -- If stock exists with BikeID = 1

-- Should succeed
DELETE FROM EVBike_Stocks WHERE LicensePlate = '29A-12345'
```

## ?? Configuration Details

### DbContext Configuration (Already Applied)
```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<EVBike_Stocks>(entity =>
{
    entity.HasKey(e => e.StockID);
    
    entity.HasIndex(e => e.LicensePlate).IsUnique();

    entity.HasOne(s => s.EVBike)
        .WithMany()
        .HasForeignKey(s => s.BikeID)
        .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict);  // Prevents cascade delete

    entity.HasOne(s => s.Station)
        .WithMany()
        .HasForeignKey(s => s.StationID)
        .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict);  // Prevents cascade delete
});
```

### Why `DeleteBehavior.Restrict`?
- Protects data integrity
- Prevents accidental deletion of bikes/stations with active stocks
- You must manually delete stocks before deleting the referenced bike/station

---

## ?? Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration Already Applied
```
The migration '20251026081500_Fix_EVBikeStocks_ForeignKey_BikeID' has already been applied to the database.
```

**Solution:** You're good! The fix is already in place.

### Issue: Cannot Drop Column EVBikeBikeID - Data Exists
```
Cannot drop column 'EVBikeBikeID' because it is being referenced by data.
```

**Solution:** Copy BikeID to EVBikeBikeID before migration:
```sql
UPDATE EVBike_Stocks SET EVBikeBikeID = BikeID WHERE EVBikeBikeID = 0 OR EVBikeBikeID IS NULL
```

### Issue: FK Constraint Violation During Migration
```
Foreign key constraint fails when migrating.
```

**Solution:** Ensure referenced bikes and stations exist:
```sql
-- Check if all BikeIDs in stocks exist in EVBikes
SELECT s.BikeID 
FROM EVBike_Stocks s
LEFT JOIN EVBikes b ON s.BikeID = b.BikeID
WHERE b.BikeID IS NULL

-- Check if all StationIDs in stocks exist in Stations
SELECT s.StationID 
FROM EVBike_Stocks s
LEFT JOIN Stations st ON s.StationID = st.StationID
WHERE st.StationID IS NULL
```

---

## ?? Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Index already exists on BikeID (was on EVBikeBikeID)
- **No data loss**: All existing data preserved
- **No breaking changes**: API endpoints remain the same

## ?? Summary

| Aspect | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| FK Column | EVBikeBikeID (shadow) | BikeID (explicit) |
| Delete Behavior | Cascade | Restrict |
| Data Integrity | Vulnerable | Protected |
| API Functionality | ? Broken | ? Working |

---
